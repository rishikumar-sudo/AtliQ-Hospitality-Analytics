Greetings, everyone!

I've successfully completed a fascinating project in the hospitality domain, and I'm excited to introduce you to "Revenue Insights in the Hospitality Industry."

## Project Overview

This project aims to harness the power of data analytics to solve real-world challenges in the hospitality industry, helping businesses optimize their revenue management strategies. The Power BI dashboard developed as part of this project offers live insights into key performance metrics including Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR), Average Daily Rate (ADR), and more.

## Key Features

- **RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room):** Critical metric for understanding revenue generation capabilities.
- **ADR (Average Daily Rate):** Provides analysis on the average rate paid for rooms sold.
- **DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights):** Tracks daily bookings to monitor trends and performance.
- **DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights):** Reflects the total number of rooms available for sale each day.
- **DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights):** Offers insights into the actual room utilization on a daily basis.

Each metric is visualized in a user-friendly dashboard that updates in real-time, providing actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions.

## Technologies Used

- **Power BI:** For creating and hosting the interactive dashboard.
- **Excel/CSV Files:** As sources for demo data to illustrate dashboard functionalities.
